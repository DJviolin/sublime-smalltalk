Smalltalk syntax for Sublime Text and TextMate
==============================================

This syntax file can be converted to .tmLanguage using PackageDev 'Convert to PList'.
Place the converted file in Packages/Smalltalk/Smalltalk.tmLanguage and reopen any .st file.

#### Update 2017.01.10

I cloned this repo and made it work with Sublime Text 3. Enjoy!
